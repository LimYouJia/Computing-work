Ms Poh walks in with a smile every morning
"HEY KIDS" she'll sing
and yet to her dismay
the class chatters to no end
BANG BANG BANG 
sometimes its thrice
sometimes its twice
and sometimes it doesn't sound
but my morning call never fails to wake me up
ah
the sound of her hydroflask.

Ding Dong, the bell goes
Hey what do you know, its geography next
in comes the man with plaid shirt or vertical lines
with a mask that slips with each "tectonic plate"


After a recess that is never long enough, 
Mrs Tang walks in (but nobody ever notices)
"textbook and exercise book"
was what I dreaded most
Oh the horror  
Sigh I wonder whats next

H I S T O R Y
another round of William Farquar with the PG name
and the betrayer Raffles who tricked the gullible sultans
