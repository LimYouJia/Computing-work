Ms Poh walks in with a smile every morning
"HEY KIDS" she'll sing
and yet to her dismay
the class chatters to no end
BANG BANG BANG 
sometimes its thrice
sometimes its twice
and sometimes it doesn't sound
but my morning call never fails to wake me up
ah
the sound of her hydroflask.

Ding Dong, the bell goes
Hey what do you know, its geography next
in comes the man with plaid shirt or vertical lines
with a mask that slips with each "tectonic plate"
He smiles on the outside but only those that really listen
know of the anger that truly lurks within

After a recess that is never long enough, 
Mrs Tang walks in (but nobody ever notices)
"textbook and exercise book"
was what I dreaded most
Oh the horror  
Sigh I wonder whats next

H I S T O R Y
another round of William Farquar with the PG name
and the betrayer Raffles who tricked the gullible sultans
oh well at least it ain't about Sang Nila Utama anymore
HA
i was wrong

Computing
Let's face it we can't stand it
so let's sit
Cos' its way better than the rest 

Oh look it's Chinese next
ya-
what
WHAT
WE'RE DOING A ZUO WEN TODAY?


Goodbye everybody

with each day
my soul leaves my body
little by little
And I am sure
that by Year 6
I would be lying in my grave :)
